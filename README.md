# Task_NER

I worked on the Intellij environment: 
  *java version "14.0.2"
  *Apache Maven 3.6.3

Follow the download instructions on https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/usage.html.

Focus on the the paragraph "Simple API".

Pull the .class and .java files to your repository and copy them in a new repository which you name src (for source)

Set the source directory consequently.

    File > Project Structure

    Under Project Settings > Modules

    Under 'Sources' tab, right-click on 'src' folder and select 'Sources'.

    Apply changes.


Use the following command line :  
                    
                    java -mx3g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLP

Have fun.
